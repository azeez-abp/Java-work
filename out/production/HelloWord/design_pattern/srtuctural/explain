These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient
Compostion and relation

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate
hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

We need two object to be linked

create Abstract or interfaces class of one;

create Interface or interface of the other;

Defination
Bridge pattern decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.(Abstraction and implementation vary)

one abstract class compose another abstract class

The Bridge builds up concrete classes in pieces.
You slowly add layers of methods that must be defined to fulfill the contract
after you extend the abstract class

tight couple the same thing perform the same function in different object
loose couple
