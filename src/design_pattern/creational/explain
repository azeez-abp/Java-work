Pattern that explain various ways we can create many object; i.e
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
prototype method create object by copy
singleton create object by allowing only one instance
factory and abstract_factory create object from factory and abstract factory class (factory is a class that contain the

builder method return one object by combining many object to form that single one (Composition)
