A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or
abstract class for creating an object (child class) but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor
It is a pattern that prevent the instantiation of concrete class

Advantage of Factory Design Pattern
Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create(Extends).
It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code
Abstract class is a class that we cannot instantiate

Implementaton
1 crate parent class
2. create child classes
3  subclasses(child) extend super class(parent)
4 create a factory class (Name it anyhow but it good to say ParentClassFactory). this class will contains
the concrete instances of all the children classes
5 To use any of the child class, create the instance of the factory that contains them and supply it name (not it instance)
